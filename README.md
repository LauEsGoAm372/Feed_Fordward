# Feed_Fordward

Exercise of implementation of a neural network with 3 dense layers, the first of 3 neurons, the second of 4 neurons and the third of 3 output neurons. The solution of the feed-forward method is done manually and using keras. Finally, a comparison of the activation methods is made.

## **Execution** 

The program is a python script with .ipynb extension, which means that it can be easily visualized in development environments such as visual studio code, colab, deepnote and others.
